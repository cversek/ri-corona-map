# ri-corona-map
A simple interactive infographic for Rhode Island COVID-19 cases by town map, hosted by GitHub Pages: [cversek.github.io/ri-corona-map](https://cversek.github.io/ri-corona-map/)  

The plot was made using the "City/Town" data table from https://health.ri.gov/data/covid-19/ and the municipalities shapefile at: http://www.rigis.org/datasets/municipalities-1997, by [Melissa Eliot, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-eliot-60746369/) using `R` with `rgdal` and `sendplot` libraries.  

Source code for the plot will be posted shortly.
